# Teaching-CO-OP-2014-Projects
Being the teaching assistant for Mr. Rocky Ieraci (Head Comp Sci teacher at Holy Names Catholic High School), I made it my duty to teach students something other than QBasic (*Not bad for beginners but we wanted to see how people would react to learning something new and trying out OOP*). The dating program is a classic program he would always demonstrate to his students so I decided to remake it in Java with a fancy GUI :)

## DatingProgram
`create`: Input a dating entry (The user has to answer 20 questions based on their preference and opinion)

`display`: Displays a list of entrys in a fancy GUI and then allows you to compare each one's compatibility

`delete`: Incase we ever want to delete a dating entry, we can do that here, also in a GUI.

## TicTacToe
This is all the Java coding we really did for games. I wanted students to have a small idea of the things they can do with Java. The **DatingProgram** only showed how to add `JComponents` to a JFrame but this program actually demonstrated how to override the `void paint(Graphics)` function in a `JFrame`.
